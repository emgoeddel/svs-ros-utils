SVS-ROS Connector

A ROS node that's also an SML Client. Allows the ROS ecosystem
to communicate with Soar through SVS.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites: Ubuntu 18.04
               ROS Melodic
               Soar (see https://soar.eecs.umich.edu/articles/articles/building-soar)
               A catkin workspace (see http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials)
               The Fetch ROS packages (fetch_gazebo and fetch_ros)

1. Clone this repo into your catkin workspace.
2. catkin build

Usage

To start a Gazebo environment with a simulated Fetch:

roslaunch svs_ros_connector start_gazebo.launch gui:="true/false" world:="name.sdf"
   gui: enables/disables the Gazebo GUI
   world: a file in the svs_ros_connector/worlds folder

To start the connection to Soar:

roslaunch svs_ros_connector svs_connector.launch remote_soar:="true/false" agent_file:="name.soar"
   remote_soar: set to true to connect to a Soar agent already running in the debugger
                set to false to create a new Soar agent
   agent_file: if remote_soar is false, provide the full path to an agent file to load
               when the agent is created
